# Data Science last four year report
If you want to add a Power BI project to GitHub and include a description, here’s a guide on how to do that:

1. **Prepare Your Power BI Files:**
   - **Power BI Report (.pbix)**: Save your Power BI report as a `.pbix` file.
   - **Supporting Files**: If you have any data sources, scripts (e.g., Power Query M scripts, DAX formulas), or documentation, include those in the project folder.

2. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
   - Click on the "Repositories" tab, then click "New" to create a new repository.
   - Name your repository (e.g., `PowerBI-Sales-Analysis`) and provide a brief description (e.g., "Power BI report analyzing sales data over the past year. Includes insights on sales trends, customer segmentation, and regional performance.").
   - Choose the visibility (Public or Private) based on your preference.
   - Click "Create repository."

3. **Upload Your Power BI Files:**
   - In your newly created repository, click "Add file" > "Upload files."
   - Drag and drop your `.pbix` file and any other supporting files into the upload area.
   - After the files are uploaded, click "Commit changes" to save them to your repository.

4. **Write a Detailed Description:**
   - On the main page of your repository (usually in the `README.md` file), provide a detailed description of your Power BI project. You can use Markdown to format the text.

Example of a README Description in Markdown:

```markdown
